Personal QA Checklist Tool
An elegant, single-file web application for freelance data annotators to create, manage, and use personalized quality assurance (QA) checklists. This tool helps ensure consistency, improve accuracy, and systematically verify the quality of annotation work before submission.

Why This Tool is a Game-Changer
In data annotation, delivering consistently high-quality work is what sets a professional freelancer apart. It reduces rework, builds client trust, and justifies higher rates. This tool transforms quality assurance from a mental process into a systematic, repeatable one.

Standardize Your Quality: Define exactly what "good" looks like for different types of projects (e.g., image segmentation vs. text sentiment analysis).

Eliminate "Silly Mistakes": A checklist ensures you don't forget common but critical checks, especially when working on large batches of data.

Build Client Confidence: You can tell clients, "I have a rigorous, multi-point QA process I run on all my work," and have the system to back it up.

Train Yourself: Creating checklists forces you to think critically about the project's requirements, making you a better, more thoughtful annotator.

Features
Zero Installation: A single HTML file that runs perfectly in any modern browser. No setup needed.

Custom Template Creation: Design and save unlimited checklist templates for different projects or task types.

Interactive Checklists: Load a template into the "Active Checklist" panel and check off items as you complete your QA process.

Visual Progress Tracking: A progress bar and item counter give you a clear, at-a-glance view of your QA progress.

Persistent Local Storage: Your custom templates are saved in your browser's local storage, so they're always there when you come back.

Clean and Intuitive: A simple, two-panel layout that's easy to understand and a pleasure to use.

How to Use
Download & Open: Save the .html file to your computer and open it with your favorite web browser.

Create a Template:

In the "Create New Template" panel, give your new checklist a Template Name (e.g., "Bounding Box QA").

Type your first checklist item into the "Add a checklist item" field and click the + button or press Enter.

Add as many items as you need. Each item represents one quality check you want to perform (e.g., "Boxes are tight, no excess space," "All target objects are labeled," "No overlapping boxes unless specified").

Once you're happy with your list, click "Save Template".

Use a Checklist:

Your saved templates will appear in the "My Templates" list.

Click the "Use" button next to the template you want to activate. It will load into the "Active Checklist" panel on the right.

As you review your annotation work, check off each item on the list. The progress bar will update automatically.

When you're done with a batch or item, click the "Reset" button to uncheck all items, making the list ready for your next QA round.

Manage Templates:

You can Delete any template you no longer need.

The "Clear All Templates" button will wipe all saved data if you want a completely fresh start.
